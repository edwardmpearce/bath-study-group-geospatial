### Research Question to Address?

- Building height is calculated as the difference between roof height and ground height based on the DSM model. Are there ways to improve how roof height and ground height are calculated?
  - Max/min/mean/median of a selection of roof points has been trialled
  - Ground points are sampled from a 10m neighbourhood around the building footprint


### Task List

Can be viewed as a geometry/computer vision problem. Some research and software already available

The rational polynomial coefficient model is a rational function, described by ratios of cubic polynomials, which maps from object space to image space.
Mathematically, this can be formulated as 
$$q:[-1,1]^{3} \to [-1,1]^{2}, \, q(x,y,z)=(s,p)$$ $$s(x,y,z) = \frac{P_{1}(x,y,z)}{P_{2}(x,y,z)}, \, p(x,y,z) = \frac{P_{3}(x,y,z)}{P_{4}(x,y,z)}$$ $$P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4}\in\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]_{3}$$ where $x,y,z$ are the normalized object space coordinates, i.e normalized latitude, longitude and height respectively. $s$ and $p$ are the normalized scanline number and pixel number between $[-1,+1]$. 

The $P_{i}$ are cubic polynomials on three variables, and so each can be described by $20$ coefficients: $$\begin{equation}\begin{split}
P_{i}(x,y,z) & = a_{i,0} + a_{i,1}x + a_{i,2}y + a_{i,3}z \; + \\
 & a_{i,4}x^{2} + a_{i,5}xy + a_{i,6}xz + a_{i,7}y^{2} + a_{i,8}yz + a_{i,9}z^{2} \; + \\
 & a_{i,10}x^{3} + a_{i,11}x^{2}y + a_{i,12}x^{2}z +  a_{i,13}xy^{2} + a_{i,14}xyz \, + \\
 & a_{i,15}xz^{2} + a_{i,16}y^{3} + a_{i,17}y^{2}z + a_{i,18}yz^{2} + a_{i,19}z^{3}
\end{split}\end{equation}$$ and without loss of generality, we can assume the constant coefficients in the denomiator polynomials are equal to $1$. That is, $a_{2,0} = a_{4,0} = P_{2}(0,0,0) = P_{2}(0,0,0) = 1$

These relate to maps from $\mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by an additional $10$ coefficients for normalization: For each coordinate, we subtract the mean value, then divide by a scaling factor equal to the maximum absolute value. For example, $X=\frac{\phi-\mu_{\phi}}{S_{\phi}}$ where $S_{\phi}=\max(|\phi_{\max} - \mu_{\phi}|, |\phi_{\min} - \mu_{\phi}|)$ where $\phi$ is the prenormalized latitude. We call $S_{\phi}, \mu_{\phi}$ the scale and offset parameters, respectively.

Such RPC models are typically fit to data by using an optimaization technique to minimize the (mean) squared error.

### Progress Against Tasks

- Sampling DSM heights across 1D line slices which pass through the target building to get a 1D height profile for analysis (repeat for multiple directions/incidence angles)
- New idea: Photogrammetry techniques and DSM generation techniques both introduce predictable forms of error relative to the true location of points in object space, and it should be possible to reverse this blurring using standard techniques from signal processing, such as deconvolution using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

### Next Steps

- Alternative approach: Shadow-length model to estimate building height, but may be more difficult in urban areas due to shadow occlusion and shadows falling onto other buildings
