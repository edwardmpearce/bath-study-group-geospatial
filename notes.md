## Estimating the Heights of Buildings from Satellite Imagery

Can be viewed as a computer vision problem, for which both research and software is currently available

## Optimal Placement of Trees

The problem as initially stated has massive scope for interpretation, with an immense number of factors to consider - ecological, legal, economical, political, ...

### Aside

When considering reforestation for climate change mitigation specifically, reforestation stands to have the greatest global impact 
in countries with large areas of suitable land and also in tropical regions due to biophysical considerations.
See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#For_climate_change_mitigation) for further details on reforestation for climate change mitigation, 
and read [this](https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-climate-change) for a thorough assessment of various climate related interventions.
It should be noted that reforestation alone is insufficient to completely counteract carbon emissions, and that reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
on both a national and international scale will also be necessary.

"In the United Kingdom, the Forestry Commission publishes Information Notes, which provide recommendations for provenance selection for UK conditions. 
The first choice of provenance should be a “selected” seed stand, preferably growing in the same region of provenance as the planting site. 
As an alternative, material from selected stands in northwestern Europe (Netherlands, northwest France, northern Germany and Belgium) is indicated. 
Seed stock from central and eastern continental Europe should not be planted, as it is poorly adapted to the UK in terms of growth rate, 
survival, phenology and resistance to foliar diseases. In some respects, the climatic dimension is taken into account by the statement that northward 
movement of genetic material (by hundreds of kilometres) may result in a gain in vigour compared with local-source provenances, whereas any 
southward movement is considered ill advised." - ([source][euforgen])
